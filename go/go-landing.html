					Outside of places like theaters, shops, and other amenities that Rochester has to offer 
					there is a huge variety of interesting and unique places for a young college student to 
					visit and explore. Not being pushed by an activity they offer the opportunity to relax and 
					experience the city at your own pace. This is a relaxing experience and some of these 
					places are sites that cannot be missed. As freshman many RIT students spend hours exploring 
					the city on weekends, some head a little further out to take in the fresh air and beauty of 
					nature. Regardless of whether you find beauty in architecture or nature, there will be an 
					experience and a nice view waiting for you in the Rochester area.
