					Pole Position Raceway - An indoor go-kart racetrack at Marketplace Mall. The go-karts are electric 
					and can reach speeds up to 45 mph. Fun Fact: Racers are given different starting times depending 
					on how fast they complete a lap in a preliminary lap. The winner of that lap gets “pole position” 
					and gets to start ahead of the other racers.

					Dave and Busters - Dave & Buster's is a national chain American restaurant and entertainment 
					(mainly arcade games) business located in The Marketplace Mall, next to Pole Position Raceway. 
					It is basically a Chuck E’ Cheese meant for adults! There’s a restaurant and bar with tons of 
					options on the menu. There’s burgers, pasta, ribs, appetizers and desserts. We recommend you 
					do the eat and play, where you can order a combo of food and gaming credits. It’s definitely worth it.
