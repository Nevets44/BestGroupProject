							Goodwill - The local GoodWill is a place to find interesting goods. Both 
							students from RIT and people from around the area regularly donate goods 
							to the store, so the wares are fairly varied and you can find things that 
							suit your interests every now and then for a fraction of original price. 
							If have any stuff left over that you donâ€™t need, you can also donate it here 
							for a good cause!

							AMVets - A thrift store that has cheaper clothing options and various knick 
							knacks from around the area. Proceeds go to supporting the members of AMVets 
							but also interests they believe will help the nation at large. A lot of college 
							students visit the Thrift Shop to get some lucky finds or find something for a party.
