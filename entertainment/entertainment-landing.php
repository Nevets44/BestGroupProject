					After a long week in the classroom RIT students are always looking for something 
					fun to do on the weekends. There is a huge variety of things to do on and off campus, 
					whether or not you want to head into town for a night of fun or be a little more 
					relaxed and enjoy a show. Rochester and the surrounding area offers a little for 
					everyone in terms of entertainment and contains fun places for college students 
					going on all weekend long. Day or night a student and friends looking for some fun 
					can always find it in Rochester, what form that fun takes depends on the student and 
					how adventurous they are feeling that day.
