						Welcome! This site is dedicated to some great attractions in Rochester. With MCC, Rochester Institute of 
						Technology, University of Rochester and others in the area, Rochester has developed great attractions for 
						college students. Traveling to a new city can be nerve wracking; unfamiliar territory! What is there to 
						do on weekends? Where are the best places to eat? Can I still participate in extracurricular activities 
						that I had at home? This site hopes to answer some of these questions from our perspective! Explore the
						 site and may it compel you to explore the city. We hope you come to love Rochester just as we have!
