							Sticky Lips Pit BBQ - A 1940's-themed barbecue restaurant. Every wall is covered 
							in newspaper clippings and ads from that time. The combo platters are named after 
							40's movie stars and warplanes. Even the drinks are named after things in that era. 
							Fountain sodas include one free refill; bottled sodas and beer are also available. 
							This is a great place to take your family when they visit. Especially because some 
							of the menu options are pricey, but it doesn't matter because your dad or mom will 
							pay for it. Also, they do have vegetarian options, so don't worry about those that 
							don't eat meat! Some of RIT student's favorite things are the Sunday brunch buffet 
							and the Atomic Bomb Challenge.

							Dinosaur Bar-B-Que - Dinosaur Bar-B-Que (aka Dinosaur BBQ and just Dinosaur) is a 
							barbeque restaurant located in the 1905 Lehigh Valley Train Station on Court Street 
							in downtown Rochester. Try to call and make a reservation because this place is 
							always busy! Dinosaur Bar-B-Que might be one of the best BBQ places in all of New York 
							state. Everything on the menu taste amazing.

							Henrietta Hots - Famous for the "Badaboom Plate", one of the many variants of the 
							original Garbage Plate. They have all the standard choices including mac salad, 
							home fries, baked beans, french fries, and salt potatoes. This is the to-go place 
							for drunk college students since they are open super late. Their "Badaboom Plates", 
							wings, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks all taste amazing.
