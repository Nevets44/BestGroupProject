					Canton House - The restaurant serves dim sum for breakfast and lunch on Saturday 
					and Sunday only. People push all the dishes around on carts, and you select what 
					you'd like when they stop by your table. You can also order from a dim sum menu. 
					This is the only dim sum place that I know of near RIT, so if you want some this 
					is the place to go. For those of you who do not know what dim sum is or have never
					 experienced dim sum, you usually go with a group of friends or family and the staff 
					 will push around dishes on a cart. You can select what you want from each cart and 
					 you pay per dish. The plates are small portions and cost anywhere between $2 to $5 or $6.

					Sodam Korean Restaurant - A Korean restaurant in the Genesee Valley Regional Market 
					(large sign on Jefferson Road). It is hard to find, you will have to look for it 
					behind Lori's Natural Foods.

					D’Mangu Restaurant - D'Mangu Dominican Restaurant is a Dominican restaurant, in 
					fact the only one, in Henrietta. Many RIT students learn about D’Mangu because 
					they are “visiting chefs” on campus at Brick City, RITZ and in Crossroads. 
					They are usually on campus two or three times a week, but if that isn’t enough 
					for you then definitely go visit the restaurant! It has a beautiful dining area, 
					and the food is delicious.

					Osaka Sushi - Osaka Sushi is an all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurant. They are 
					located in Chili Paul Plaza. We highly recommend eating at this restaurant for sushi. 
					Absolutely amazing! The all-you-can-eat is not only for sushi, but also for appetizers, 
					sashimi, fried tempura, dinner entrees, and dessert! Some of the tastiest appetizers 
					include the gyozas, Japanese wontons, spring rolls, avocado salad, seaweed salad, 
					and fried scallops. All kinds of fish are available, including salmon, tuna, white 
					tuna, yellowtail, red snapper, and eel! There are over 20+ different sushi rolls 
					that you can order, some of our favorites are the Volcano Roll, Osaka Roll, and 
					Dragon Roll! Make sure to order some shrimp tempura, sweet potato tempura, teriyaki, 
					fried rice, or udon! There’s too much on the menu to list, you’ll just have to check 
					it out.

					Thali of India - Thali of India is an Indian restaurant located in Win-Jeff Plaza. 
					They offer a daily lunch buffet, as well as a dinner buffet on Monday evenings. 
					They are also visiting chefs on campus at Brick City, RITZ, and in Crossroads. 
					They are usually on campus two or three times a week, but if that isn’t enough for 
					you then go and try the lunch buffet or dinner buffet! They have all kinds of curry, 
					rice and side dishes. Also, they constantly refill your table with fresh naan and 
					it’s absolutely amazing.

					SEA Restaurant- A Vietnamese restaurant on the corner of Monroe Avenue and Rutgers 
					Street that serves a variety of dishes from Vietnam and Thailand. They feature a 
					lot of traditional Vietnamese and Thai flavors, including mint, cilantro, lime and 
					peanuts. This restaurant has a nice authentic feel when you dine in. Their pho and 
					rice vermicelli dinner entrees taste authentic and delicious. So if the weather is 
					snowy and cold in Rochester, this is a great place to get a huge bowl of nice warm 
					soup for only $8.

					Seoul House - Seoul House is a Korean restaurant on West Henrietta Road in Brighton. 
					Most of the tables have built-in grills, for barbecue. Dinner comes with several side 
					dishes including kimchi, radish, tofu, black beans, and steamed rice. Korean BBQ is 
					very popular among Americans and it is a great dinner option for a large group of 
					friends. Order a ton of meat that you can cook in front of you, and it comes with 
					lettuce, rice and a bunch of side dishes. You can wrap the rice and meat inside the 
					lettuce and they also give you this delicious sauce.
