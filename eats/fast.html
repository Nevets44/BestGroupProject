					DiBella’s Old Fashioned Subs - DiBella's is a Rochester-based chain that specializes in 
					"old fashioned" subs. If you want a submarine sandwich or some good soups, DiBella’s 
					is the place to go. It’s a favorite for both Rochester natives as well as pretty much 
					every RIT student.

					Pi Craft - A fast casual pizzeria which specializes in hand crafted pizza using a 
					revolving stone oven with temperatures up to 1000 degrees which will cook the pizza 
					in 6 minutes. It is similar to Chipotle where you wait in line and the staff work 
					in an assembly line fashion. You can order from two different sizes, a pi size 
					(6 inches) or a 12 inch pizza. There are different sauces including tomato, tomato basil, 
					BBQ, alfredo, and pesto. Cheeses include mozzarella, parmesan, asiago, and a few others. 
					Proteins include chicken, pepperoni, sausage, turkey sausage, bacon, and meatballs. 
					There are all kinds of other toppings available including peppers, onions, pineapple, 
					mushrooms, banana peppers, anchovies, basil, spinach, arugula, black pepper, olive oil 
					and so much more. If you want to craft your own pizza concoction, definitely take a trip 
					to Pi Craft!

					Mighty Taco - Small place with a drive through where you can find inexpensive tacos 
					burritos, fajitas, nachos and salads. Many don’t really know why RIT students love to 
					go to Mighty Taco, but they for whatever reason still go there.
