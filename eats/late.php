							Calios (formerly Zonies) - Calios is a small New York chain restaurant that 
							serves over 50 kinds of calzones, create-your-own option, wings and fries. 
							It is located in Jefferson Plaza near RIT. The place has free delivery until 
							4:00AM and special deals for college students. Every Monday they have a "two 
							for the time" deal where you can buy two calzones that cost the amount of the 
							current time. It starts at 6:00pm, so 2 calzones will cost $6. At 7:00pm, 2 
							calzones will cost $7. Make sure to call right at 6:00pm because the lines go 
							crazy busy. They also have other deals like 4 calzones for $22 dollars and 
							calzone appetizer combos. Many people don't know about Calios' fries but they 
							are some of the best fries ever. It's the to-go place after a night of drinking 
							and you need some carbs to sober up!

							D.P. Dough - D.P. Dough is a national chain restaurant that serves over 20 kinds 
							of calzones, wings and tots. It is located in Henrietta Jefferson Plaza near RIT, 
							a few feet from Calios (our personal favorite calzone place!) D.P. Dough is a little 
							cheaper than Calios, but also doesn't taste as good. If you want calzones, wings, 
							or fries please go to Calios! D.P. Dough, more like D.P. Don't.

							Cam's Pizzeria - Cam's Pizzeria is a local pizzeria chain with multiple locations 
							in the Rochester area. The most visited one is in downtown Rochester where all the 
							drunk college kids like to go after a night out. They sell slices of pepperoni or 
							cheese right at the door for only $3, and the slices are pretty big. You can get 
							in line and wait for some speciality slices like Sweet & Tangy Chicken Bacon, Buffalo 
							Chicken, Meat Lovers, Pepperoni and Banana Peppers, Peppers and Onions, and Sausage. 
							They also have wings, cannolis, and cakes but if you're drunk the pizza will definitely 
							help.
