							McKenzie’s Irish Pub - McKenzie's Irish Pub, formerly known as Tipsy McStaggers, 
							is a bar on West Henrietta Road near Marketplace Mall. It is very popular bar among 
							RIT students because of the special deals available throughout the week. Taco 
							Tuesdays means $1 tacos starting at 4pm until they run out, along with free pong 
							and pool! Wednesday nights from 8pm to midnight they have unlimited wings for $10, 
							flavors include mild, hot, BBQ, honey mustard, garlic parmesan, and a few more. 
							It’s also Trivia Night on Wednesdays and you can win money towards your bar tab! 
							Thursday night is COLLEGE NIGHT and they have $1 pints of Blue Ribbon and Genesee. 
							How can you pass up on dollar pints? The only thing is RIT students tend to squad up 
							at MacGregor’s on Thursdays. Lastly Saturdays has $1 hotdogs and $1.50 hamburgers all 
							day! So if you want to go to a bar with a budget, McKenzie’s Irish Pub is the perfect place.

							Bar Louie - Bar Louie is a chain restaurant and bar located on Jefferson Road in 
							Henrietta. It is the former Bugaboo Creek Steak House. It opened December 2015 and 
							serves mainly American bar and grill style food. It is a modern bar with lots of 
							seating and TVs set up, becoming a go-to bar for students when their family and 
							friends visit the area. They also have a deal on Tuesdays where you can get a 
							burger with fries for only $5! How can you pass up on an offer like that? Some 
							other really popular and tasty items on their menu include the Thai Chicken 
							Lettuce Wraps, Loaded Fries, and their Signature Nachos.

							Filgers East End - Filgers East End is a bar in the Upper East End area. 
							They have over fifty different types of beers on tap, including craft brews. 
							They opened in April 2015, it was previously a MacGregor's. Filgers has become 
							a favorite for RIT students on Saturday nights. RIT provides a bus system, what 
							we have come to call the “drunk bus” on Saturday nights that start at 10:30pm 
							and ends at 2:00am. The bus comes around the campus areas at 10:30, 11:30, 12:30 
							and finally 1:30. The bus goes to Park Point, Park Point/Perkins crosswalk, Colony, 
							Dormside and University Commons. Make sure you get on the 2:00am bus downtown because 
							that’s the last one! It’s going to be a pain if you’re drunk and get stuck with no 
							ride home. I recommend going on the 10:30 bus to avoid waiting in line, because the 
							11:30 bus usually results in a huge line outside Filgers extending down the street!

							Butapub - ButaPub is a unique and interesting pub with menu inspirations from Asia. 
							Food includes ramen, banh mi sandwiches, and standard bar fare such as wings and burgers. 
							They are most well known for their pig’s head platter, which has a real pig’s head on
							 a plate. This dish serves 4-6 people. ButaPub is located in the German House, in 
							 the South Wedge neighborhood. This is a great place if you and your friends or family 
							 want to try pig’s head. The dish has a cooked pig’s head, pig meat, buns, garnishes like 
							 spring onion and cilantro, and different sauces. I definitely think this is something 
							 you need to try before you leave the RIT area!
